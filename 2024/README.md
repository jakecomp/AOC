# Advent of Code 2024

## Goals for this year

My main goal for this year's AOC is to test out my Ruby chops. At work, I mostly use Go, but the main monolith is written in Ruby on Rails. I want to further explore the language and start contributing more Ruby code at work, so I think AOC is a great oppurtunity to deepen by Ruby knowledge.

Of course, my other main goal is to have fun, and refresh my knowledge on certain algorithms which I'm sure will come up.
